THE NATURE OF PLEASURE
{pleasure['nature_of_pleasure']['definition']}. True pleasure is not excess or
indulgence but the stable condition of well-being - what Epicurus calls
katastematic pleasure. {pleasure['katastematic_pleasure']['priority']}

CLASSIFICATION OF DESIRES
We must distinguish what we desire:
- Natural and necessary: {desires['natural_and_necessary']['description']}
- Natural but unnecessary: {desires['natural_but_unnecessary']['description']}
- Unnatural and unnecessary: {desires['unnatural_and_unnecessary']['description']}
{desires['wisdom']}

THE FOUR-PART REMEDY
The Tetrapharmakos addresses our deepest fears:
1. {tetrapharmakos['god_not_feared']['maxim']}: {tetrapharmakos['god_not_feared']['explanation']}
2. {tetrapharmakos['death_not_felt']['maxim']}: {tetrapharmakos['death_not_felt']['explanation']}
3. {tetrapharmakos['good_easily_obtained']['maxim']}: {tetrapharmakos['good_easily_obtained']['explanation']}
4. {tetrapharmakos['evil_easily_endured']['maxim']}: {tetrapharmakos['evil_easily_endured']['explanation']}

PATH TO TRANQUILITY
{ataraxia['nature']['description']}. We achieve this through philosophy,
simple living, and withdrawal from unnecessary troubles.
{ataraxia['lathe_biosas']['maxim']}: {ataraxia['lathe_biosas']['meaning']}

REGARDING DEATH
{mortality['epicurus_argument']['description']}: {mortality['epicurus_argument']['reasoning']}
{mortality['symmetry_argument']['description']}: {mortality['symmetry_argument']['reasoning']}

THE VALUE OF FRIENDSHIP
{friendship['centrality']['claim']}. The Garden teaches us that
the good life is lived among friends. {friendship['benefits']['philosophy']}

PRUDENT CALCULATION
{prudence['centrality']['claim']}. We must weigh pleasures and pains wisely,
sometimes accepting present pain for future pleasure, sometimes rejecting
present pleasure to avoid future pain. {prudence['long_term_thinking']['principle']}

Thus Epicurean wisdom counsels: Pursue simple, natural pleasures;
dissolve irrational fears through understanding; cultivate friendship;
and live a quiet life of philosophical contentment."""
