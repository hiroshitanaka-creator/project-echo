"""
Nagarjuna - Madhyamaka Buddhist Philosopher

Nagarjuna (c. 150-250 CE)
Focus: Emptiness (Sunyata), Middle Way, Two Truths, Dependent Origination

Key Concepts:
- Sunyata (Emptiness): All phenomena are empty of inherent existence (svabhava)
- Two Truths: Conventional truth (samvrti) and ultimate truth (paramartha)
- Pratityasamutpada: Dependent origination - everything arises in dependence
- Catuskoti (Tetralemma): Four-cornered negation logic
- Svabhava: Critique of inherent existence or self-nature
- Nirvana-Samsara identity: Ultimately non-different
- Madhyamaka: The Middle Way between eternalism and nihilism
- Prasangika: Reductio ad absurdum argumentation
- Conventional language: Use while recognizing its limits
- Upaya (Skillful means): Teaching adapted to capacity
