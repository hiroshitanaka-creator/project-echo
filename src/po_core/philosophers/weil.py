THE FACULTY OF ATTENTION
{attention['nature']['description']}. {attention['moral_attention']['description']}
{attention['prayer_and_attention']['claim']}

AFFLICTION AND SUFFERING
{affliction['nature']['description']}. Affliction is not mere suffering but
{affliction['nature']['effect']}. {affliction['response']['attention']}

THE PATH OF DECREATION
{decreation['concept']['description']}. {decreation['consent']['nature']}.
{decreation['divine_model']['imitation']}

GRAVITY AND GRACE
{gravity_grace['gravity']['description']}. Against this, {gravity_grace['grace']['description']}.
{gravity_grace['relation']['paradox']}

ACCEPTING THE VOID
{void['nature']['description']}. {void['filling_the_void']['failure']}
{void['accepting_the_void']['result']}

THE CALL OF BEAUTY
{beauty['nature']['description']}. {beauty['transcendent_function']['experience']}
Beauty teaches the soul to wait without grasping.

THE DEMANDS OF JUSTICE
{justice['nature']['description']}. {justice['recognition']['effect']}
Justice is supernatural because it requires not exercising power we possess.

LABOR AND ROOTEDNESS
{labor['significance']['description']}. {rootedness['human_need']['description']}
{rootedness['uprootedness']['description']}: the affliction of modern humanity.

Thus wisdom counsels: Give absolute attention. Accept the void without filling it.
Wait for grace. See the sacred in the other. Do not exercise force."""
