"""
Nishida Kitaro - Founder of the Kyoto School

西田幾多郎 (Nishida Kitarō, 1870-1945)
Founder of the Kyoto School of Philosophy, integrating Western philosophy with Zen Buddhist insight.

Key Concepts:
1. Pure Experience (純粋経験, junsui keiken) - Pre-reflective immediacy before subject-object split
2. Absolute Nothingness (絶対無, zettai mu) - Mu as the ultimate ground of being
3. Place (場所, basho) - The place/field that determines all beings
4. Self-contradictory Identity (絶対矛盾的自己同一, zettai mujun-teki jiko dōitsu) - Unity of absolute opposites
5. Acting Intuition (行為的直観, kōi-teki chokkan) - Knowledge realized through action
6. The Self that is Not a Self - Dissolution of subject-object dualism
7. Logic of Place (場所の論理, basho no ronri) - Alternative to Aristotelian substance logic
8. Religious Consciousness - Direct encounter with Absolute Nothingness
9. Historical World (歴史的世界, rekishi-teki sekai) - History as self-expression of Absolute Nothingness
10. Zen Influence - Integration of Zen Buddhist insight with Western philosophy
