"""
Laozi (Lao Tzu) - Daoist Philosopher

Laozi (c. 6th century BCE, traditional dating)
Focus: Tao Te Ching, The Way (Dao), Non-action (Wu Wei)

Key Concepts:
- Tao (道): The Way - ineffable source and principle of all things
- Wu Wei (無為): Non-action, effortless action, going with the flow
- Te (德): Virtue/Power that flows from alignment with Tao
- Pu (朴): The Uncarved Block - natural simplicity before conditioning
- Yin-Yang: Complementary opposites in dynamic balance
- Fu (復): Return - returning to the source, the root
- Soft Overcomes Hard: Water metaphor, flexibility wins
- Emptiness and Usefulness: The usefulness of nothing
- Wu (無): Non-being from which being emerges
- Sage-Ruler: Leadership through non-interference
