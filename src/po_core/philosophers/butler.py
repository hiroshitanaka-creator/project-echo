    Judith Butler (1956-)

    American philosopher and gender theorist whose work has

    Influenced by Foucault, Derrida, and psychoanalysis,
    Butler argues that gender is performatively constituted
    through repeated acts and that subversion is possible
    through critical engagement with these norms.

PERFORMATIVITY
{performativity['concept']['description']}. {performativity['concept']['effect']}
{performativity['citation']['description']}. {performativity['citation']['implication']}

TROUBLING GENDER
{gender_trouble['destabilization']['target']}. By showing the constructed nature
of what seems natural, we reveal contingency. {gender_trouble['trouble_as_method']['description']}

BODIES THAT MATTER
{bodies['materialization']['description']}. But not all bodies matter equally.
{bodies['which_bodies_matter']['exclusion']}. The boundary is political.

THE HETERONORMATIVE MATRIX
{matrix['structure']['description']}. {matrix['regulatory_ideal']['effect']}
The matrix produces coherent subjects while excluding others.

PRECARITY AND VULNERABILITY
{precarity['precariousness']['description']}. But {precarity['precarity']['description']}.
Our shared vulnerability grounds ethical and political response.

GRIEVABILITY
{grievability['grievable_lives']['description']}. {grievability['ungrievable_lives']['consequence']}
We must contest the frames that determine whose lives count.

RECOGNITION
{recognition['subject_formation']['description']}. {recognition['norms_of_recognition']['exclusion']}
The struggle is for forms of recognition that do not violate.

POSSIBILITIES FOR SUBVERSION
{subversion['subversive_repetition']['description']}. {subversion['resignification']['politics']}
Working within the terms of power, we can destabilize them.

This analysis asks: What norms are operating? Who is excluded?
How might we work toward more livable lives for all?"""
