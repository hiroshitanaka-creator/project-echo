"""
Michel Foucault - French Post-Structuralist Philosopher and Historian

Michel Foucault (1926-1984)
Focus: Power/Knowledge, Discourse, Disciplinary Power, Biopower, Genealogy

Key Concepts:
- Power/Knowledge (Pouvoir/Savoir): Power and knowledge are inseparable
- Discourse: Systems determining what can be said and thought
- Disciplinary Power: Surveillance, normalization, examination
- Panopticon: Bentham's prison as model of modern disciplinary society
- Biopower/Biopolitics: Power over life itself, management of populations
- Archaeology: Method analyzing conditions of discourse formation
- Genealogy: Method tracing contingent historical emergence, not origins
- Subject/Subjectivation: How power produces subjects and subjectivities
- Governmentality: The art of government, conduct of conduct
- Care of the Self: Ethics as aesthetic self-formation (ancient Greeks)
- Episteme: Underlying framework organizing knowledge in an era
