"""
Sartre - Existentialist Philosopher

Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980)
Focus: Existence precedes Essence, Freedom, Responsibility, Bad Faith

Key Concepts:
- Existence precedes essence: We create our own nature through choices
- Radical freedom: We are "condemned to be free"
- Responsibility: We are responsible for our choices and the world
- Bad faith (mauvaise foi): Self-deception to escape freedom
- For-itself vs In-itself: Conscious being vs thing-like being
- The gaze of the Other: How others' perception affects us
- Anguish (angoisse): The dizziness of freedom
- Engagement (engagement): Commitment and action
- The Look (le regard): Being seen objectifies us
- Nausea (la nausée): Confronting the absurd contingency of existence
- Facticity and transcendence: The tension between given facts and projects
- Being-for-others: Our being as it appears to others
- Shame and pride: Responses to the Look
- The body: Three ontological dimensions of embodiment
- Situation: The concrete context of freedom
- Project: Fundamental life project and choices
- Condemned to freedom: The weight of absolute freedom
