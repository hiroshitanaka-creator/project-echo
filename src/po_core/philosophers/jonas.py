THE IMPERATIVE OF RESPONSIBILITY
{responsibility['new_imperative']['formulation']}. {responsibility['new_imperative']['scope']}
Our technological power demands an ethics commensurate with our capacity to affect the future.

FUTURE GENERATIONS
{future['existence_of_obligation']['ground']}. {future['content_of_obligation']['preservation']}
We bear responsibility for those not yet born who cannot speak for themselves.

HEURISTICS OF FEAR
{fear['role_of_fear']['function']}. {fear['primacy_of_bad_prognosis']['principle']}
When the stakes are existential, caution is wisdom.

TECHNOLOGY AND POWER
{technology['changed_condition']['description']}. {technology['characteristics']['irreversible']}
The novelty of our power requires a new kind of ethical thinking.

THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF LIFE
{life['metabolism']['description']}. {life['needful_freedom']['tension']}
Life itself embodies value and purposiveness.

BEING AND OUGHT
{ontological_ethics['life_as_value']['claim']}. {ontological_ethics['the_ought_in_being']['argument']}
Ethics is grounded in the being of life itself.

VULNERABILITY AND CARE
{vulnerability['vulnerability_and_responsibility']['description']}.

ECOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY
{ecological['nature_as_end']['description']}. {ecological['holistic_responsibility']['stewardship']}
