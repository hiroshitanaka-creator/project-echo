Parmenides Philosopher Module

Implements pre-Socratic ontology based on Parmenides's philosophy.

Key concepts:
- Being: That which is, the fundamental reality
- Non-Being: That which is not, impossible to think or speak
- The Way of Truth: Philosophical reasoning about reality
- The Way of Opinion: Mortal beliefs about appearances
- Monism: Reality is one, unchanging, indivisible
- Immutability: Being does not change
- Completeness: Being lacks nothing
- Rational Inquiry: Thought and being are the same
- Goddess's Revelation: Divine source of philosophical truth
- Appearance vs Reality: Distinction between seeming and being
