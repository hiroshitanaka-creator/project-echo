Heidegger - Phenomenological Philosopher

Martin Heidegger (1889-1976)
Focus: Being and Time, Dasein (Being-there), Existential Analysis

Key Concepts:
- Dasein: Human existence as "being-in-the-world"
- Being vs. Beings: The ontological difference
- Temporality: Past, present, and future as constitutive of being
- Authenticity vs. Inauthenticity (Eigentlichkeit/Uneigentlichkeit)
- Geworfenheit: Thrownness - we are thrown into existence
- Sorge: Care - the fundamental structure of Dasein
- Befindlichkeit: Attunement/mood - how we find ourselves
- Verfallen: Fallenness - absorption in the everyday
- Das Man: The "they" - anonymous existence
- Angst: Anxiety - reveals the nothing
- Sein-zum-Tode: Being-toward-death
- Gelassenheit: Releasement/letting-be
- Lichtung: Clearing - where Being reveals itself
- Ereignis: The event of appropriation
- Technik: The essence of technology
- Aletheia: Truth as unconcealment
