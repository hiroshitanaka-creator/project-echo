"""
Hegel - German Idealist Philosopher

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831)
Focus: Dialectic, Absolute Idealism, Phenomenology of Spirit, Historical Development

Key Concepts:
- Dialectic: Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis / Aufhebung (sublation)
- Geist (Spirit/Mind): Absolute Spirit realizing itself through history
- Phenomenology of Spirit: Journey of consciousness to absolute knowing
- Master-Slave Dialectic: Recognition and self-consciousness through struggle
- Absolute Idealism: Reality is the self-development of Spirit/Absolute
- Concrete Universal: The universal that contains and develops its particulars
- Contradiction: Engine of development, not logical error
- History as Progress: Spirit's self-realization through historical development
- Freedom: Spirit's essential nature, realized in rational state
- The Absolute: The whole, truth as systematic totality
- Recognition (Anerkennung): Mutual recognition constituting self-consciousness
