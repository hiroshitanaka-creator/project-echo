"""
Derrida - Deconstructionist Philosopher

Jacques Derrida (1930-2004)
Focus: Deconstruction, Différance, Trace, Binary Opposition

Key Concepts:
- Deconstruction: Revealing hidden assumptions and contradictions
- Différance: Difference + deferral of meaning (with an 'a')
- Trace: The absent presence, what is excluded to define something
- Binary Opposition: Hierarchical oppositions (speech/writing, presence/absence)
- Logocentrism: Critique of the privilege of presence and voice
- Phonocentrism: Privilege of speech over writing
- Supplement: What is added also reveals a lack
- Arche-writing: Writing as condition of all signification
- Dissemination: Proliferation and scattering of meaning
- Pharmakon: Undecidable - both poison and cure
- Hospitality: Unconditional welcome vs conditional hospitality
- Hauntology: Being haunted by absent presences
- Iterability: Repeatability that introduces difference
- Aporia: Impasses, undecidable moments
- Gift: The impossibility of the pure gift
- Justice: Justice vs Law (law is deconstructible, justice is not)
