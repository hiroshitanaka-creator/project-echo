"""
Simone de Beauvoir - Existentialist Feminist Philosopher

Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986)
Focus: Gender as Constructed, The Other, Immanence vs Transcendence, Situated Freedom

Key Concepts:
- "One is not born a woman, one becomes one": Gender is constructed, not innate
- The Other: Woman defined as the eternal Other to man's Subject
- Immanence vs Transcendence: Women confined to immanence, denied transcendence
- Situated Freedom: Freedom always exercised within a concrete historical situation
- Oppression: How patriarchy systematically limits women's possibilities
- Ambiguity: Embracing moral and existential ambiguity
- Projects: Existence defined through self-chosen projects
- Bad Faith in Gender Roles: Accepting imposed feminine identities
- Reciprocity: Genuine mutual recognition between subjects
- Lived Experience: Philosophy must be grounded in concrete lived experience
- The Second Sex: Women as defined by their relation to men, not autonomously
- Economic Independence: Essential for women's freedom
- Myth of Femininity: Cultural myths that naturalize women's oppression
- Body as Situation: The body as a situation to transcend, not destiny
