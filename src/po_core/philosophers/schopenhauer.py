"""
Arthur Schopenhauer - German Pessimist Philosopher

Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860)
Focus: Will, Representation, Pessimism, Aesthetic Contemplation, Compassion

Key Concepts:
- Will (Wille): Blind, irrational striving underlying all reality
- Representation (Vorstellung): World as appearance to the subject
- Pessimism: Life is suffering - existence is fundamentally bad
- Aesthetic Contemplation: Temporary escape from willing through art
- Compassion (Mitleid): Basis of morality - feeling others' suffering as one's own
- Denial of the Will: Salvation through asceticism and resignation
- Principium Individuationis: Maya's veil - illusion of separateness
- Music: Direct objectification of the Will itself
- Boredom and Suffering: Pendulum between pain and ennui
- Nothingness: The goal of will-denial - better than existence
