"""
Edmund Husserl - Founder of Phenomenology

Edmund Husserl (1859-1938)
Focus: Phenomenology, Consciousness, Intentionality, Transcendental Subjectivity

Key Concepts:
- Phenomenological Reduction (Epoché): Bracketing the natural attitude
- Intentionality: Consciousness is always consciousness-of-something
- Noesis and Noema: Acts of consciousness and their intentional objects
- Lifeworld (Lebenswelt): Pre-theoretical background of lived experience
- Transcendental Ego: The pure I as constituting subject
- Essence (Eidos): Eidetic intuition of essential structures
- Horizons: Inner and outer horizons of experiential givenness
- Time-Consciousness: Retention, primal impression, protention
- Intersubjectivity: Constitution of other subjects in experience
- Evidence (Evidenz): Self-givenness and fulfillment of intention
- Natural Attitude vs Phenomenological Attitude
- Constitution: How consciousness constitutes objects and meaning
- Categorial Intuition: Grasping formal and material essences
- Apodictic Evidence: Absolute certainty and self-evidence
